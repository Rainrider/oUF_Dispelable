# oUF_Dispelable

This is an element for the popular unitframe framework oUF ([Curse](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ouf) / [WoWI](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info9994-oUF.html)).  
It does nothing by itself and requires layout support to do its magic.

## Description

oUF_Dispelable provides functionality to highlight debuffs dispelable by the player. It can display either a texture 
colored by the debuff type, or an icon representing the found dispelable debuff, or both.

It enables and disables itself automatically based on whether the player can dispel or not and keeps an always updated 
list of the dispel spells available to the player. It also keeps track of self-dispels like [Grimoire: Imp](http://www.wowdb.com/spells/111859) 
and [Cleansed by Flame](http://www.wowdb.com/spells/205625) to only highlight the player frame when only those are known.

## How to use

The element is fully documented and follows the current oUF guidelines for documentation. Please take a look at the code 
for details and examples. You could also consult the [wiki](https://github.com/Rainrider/oUF_Dispelable/wiki).
